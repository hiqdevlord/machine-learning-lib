mymllib
=======

A small and personal library of `machine learning
<http://www.ml-class.org>`_ functions for use with `GNU Octave
<http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/>`_.

You may add these functions to your load path via the `addpath
<http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Manipulating-the-load-path.html>`_
function in your ``~/.octaverc``.

You may run some basic tests that are included in this library by
typing in into the Octave interpreter::

  mymllibTestAll;
